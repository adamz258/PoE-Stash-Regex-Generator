'''Regex''', or '''Regular Expressions''', are strings of characters that can be used as shorthand to search for one or more specific results. Within the context of Path of Exile, it can be used to filter content in text such as specific stats or modifiers, or for specific item base types.

Below are some examples of regex that can be copied and pasted into search input fields in-game.
